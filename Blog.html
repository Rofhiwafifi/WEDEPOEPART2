<li>3. Be curious- ask questions politely and show enthusiasm.

<article>
<p align="right"><em><font color="black">By Guest Writer| August 22,2025</font></p></em>
<p><font color="black">Many students think that job shadowing is just about watching someone work but it is much more than that.
Job shadowing helps you see day-to-day reality of a profession, the callenges people face and the skill that you 
need. It allows you to test whether a career is right for you before investing years of study. For employers,
it is also a chance to meet motivated students who could become future employees.</font></p></article>
